# Timely
Chrome extension that allows the user to select websites to track, and subsequently tracks and stores the time the users spends on those websites
- Groups websites by domain, popup shows a table of the latest website's title, the domain, and the time spent formatted in days, hours, minutes, and seconds
- Options page gives user the functionality to add and remove websites to track, with dark and light mode styling options
- Created with React, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap (Webpack for bundling and distribution)
- Everything is stored locally using Chrome's Storage API, and data is obtained using Chrome's Tabs API

Upon install, a page is shown to the user to allow them to change their settings, and more importantly add urls to track. 
This can be re-accessed by accessing the options page of the extension.
